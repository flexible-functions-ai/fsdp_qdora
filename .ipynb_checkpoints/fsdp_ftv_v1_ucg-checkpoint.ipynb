    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ugandan Ministry of Health and its partners published the Uganda Clinical Guidelines to help give practitioners access to the latest up-to-date information on how to diagnose and manage common health conditions in Uganda.\n",

    "> **What is the aim of the UCG?**\n",
    "> \n",
    ">The UCG aims to provide summarized easy-to-use, practical, complete and useful information on how to quickly and correctly diagnose and manage common conditions you are likely to encounter. This will ensure that patients receive the best possible clinical services and obtain prompt and effective relief from or cure of their complaint, thereby making the most appropriate use of scarce diagnostic and clinical resources, including medicines. It should, however, be emphasised that the UCG does not replace or substituteavailable textbooks on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why is the UCG necessary?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Medicine is an ever-evolving and expanding field in terms of needs and knowledge. The UCG helps the country to prioritize and effectively use limited resources by guiding the procurement system to ensure the availability of the most needed medicines and supplies. In the context of new knowledge and changing priorities, as a tool, the UCG assists health workers in their daily practice by providing information in an easy-to-follow and practical format.\n",

    "You can find a link to the Uganda clinical guidelines [here](https://library.health.go.ug/uganda-clinical-guidelines-2023). With this, we are experimenting with fine-tuning a large language model on these guidelines. The hope is that this model can be used as a basis for an assistive tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Uganda clinical guidelines have over 1000+ pages containing information such as clinical features, causes, differential diagnoses, treatment, and prevention options for many common health complaints in Uganda. I shall be fine-tuning a Llama 3 70B parameter model using Full Sharded Data Parallel developed by Meta, which helps us distribute our parameters across multiple GPUs, allowing us to use them in parallel. This used in conjuction with QDora which brings quantitization to , \n",
    "Quantitization is a technique where instead of using 32 or 16 bits to store the weights of a neural network, 4 are used\n",
    "\n",
    "an open-source system first introduced in this answer.ai [post](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-04-26-fsdp-qdora-llama3.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "This method enables us to efficiently and cheaply fine-tune large models with billions of parameters on consumer hardware, as opposed to using data center-class GPUs, which cost thousands of dollars more. Remember, each parameter usually takes 16 bits (2 bytes), so thatâ€™s 70*2=140GB to even store the weights without thinking of the other data like the gradients etc."
